Project - Flying Taxi

This project offer an analysis of the development of Minimum Viable Product(MVP) for the Flying Taxi in one of the most congested cities in America, New York City. The idea presented here demonstrates the process involved in bringing the first flying car taxi service to market by analyzing data and building a product proposal.

Due to the fact that the business model is first of its kind, with little or no existing data, I have used acquired taxi data for a comparable initial analysis. The dataset contains real taxi drop-offs and pick-ups in New York City.

Project activities centered around:
  Setting Product Objectives and Strategy
  Proposal Synthesis and Design
  The Business Case

Tableau, Jupyter Notebook and PostgreSQL are the tools used for analyzing and calculating the average, median, and the first & second standard deviation of the mean for the following measures:
1. Duration
2. Distance
3. Passenger counts
4. Duration-to-distance ratio
5. Price per mile
