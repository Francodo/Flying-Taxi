Project - Flying Taxi

This project offer an analysis of the development of Minimum Viable Product(MVP) for the Flying Taxi in one of the most congested cities in America, New York City. The idea presented here demonstrates the process involved in bringing the first flying car taxi service to market by analyzing data and building a product proposal.

Due to the fact that the business model is first of its kind, with little or no existing data, I have used acquired taxi data for a comparable initial analysis. The dataset contains real taxi drop-offs and pick-ups in New York City.

Tableau and PostgreSQL are the tools used for data analysis.
